# stats170
It's the project for STATS 170B. The project predicts the list price of a used car based on the car information.

Our notebooks were divided based on the steps in the project:
- We started with “data wrangling.ipynb” where we cleaned Craigslist dataset and Edmunds dataset. 
- We merged the datasets in “match algorithm.ipynb”. 
- We did exploratory data analysis in “visualization.ipynb” and we drew a location heatmap in “map.py”.
- We worked on feature engineering in “categorical endoe.ipynb”, “NLP.ipynb” and “PCA.ipynb”. 
- Last, we did modeling and evaluation in “modeling.ipynb”. 

Datasets:

- vehicles.csv is the original Craigslist dataset downloaded from Kaggle. 
- cars4.csv is the merged dataset after data processing.
- cars ml.csv is the final dataset which is ready for machine learning. 
- edmunds.zip is the original Edmunds dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
- edmunds review.csv is the processed Edmunds dataset.
