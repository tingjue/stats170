If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Reviews:  * Agile handling; fuel-efficient V6; quiet cabin; configurable second-row seat; easy-to-fold third-row seat; top crash test scores. Source: Edmunds  * The Honda Odyssey is a clear choice for a family looking for a practical, comfortable, fuel-efficient, feature-packed 8-passenger hauler. It's easily better at those tasks than a full-sized SUV, and there's nothing like those sliding doors when you're in a tight parking lot. Source: KBB.com  * The Honda Odyssey has a wide, low stance with a modern aerodynamic feel. Its fresh, angled lines, combined with updates to its front end, grille, and rear taillights result in a bold design. Take into consideration its great records for reliability and safety combined with fact that it is enjoyable and comfortable to drive, and this is one vehicle should not be missed. Depending on the trim level you select, it can seat up to 7 or 8 passengers. The third row seats are split, and each seat can fold flat into the floor. The outside seats in the second row can slide towards the walls, so that three child safety seats can fit next to one another. The Multi-Function 2nd-Row Center Seat, on EX trims and above, can either fold forward to become a center console or slide forward 5.5 inches to enable a child seat to be closer to the driver and front passenger. For extra cargo space, one or all of the second row seats can be removed as well. Powering the Odyssey is a 3.5L V6 engine, with 248 hp, which gets an EPA estimated 19 MPG City and 28 MPG hwy. The base Odyssey, comes standard with such items as a rearview camera, an AM FM CD Radio with 7 speakers and a color 8-inch interface screen, Bluetooth connectivity, and power front seats. Higher trims come with features like power sliding doors, LaneWatch camera system, navigation, 3-zone climate control, leather, and a power lift tailgate. The top-of-the-line Touring Elite trim gives you things like the amazing Honda DVD Ultrawide Rear Entertainment System, and a premium 12 speaker sound system with surround sound. The Touring Elite also gives you the convenience of the innovative HondaVac, which is a vacuum cleaner integrated with the car to help fight day-to-day messes.

Good running project jeep that could use some TLC. I've owned the jeep for 2 and a half years and it hasn't failed me yet. I used it to commute from Dillon down to Pocatello for workon weekends for a while, then used it to commute from Cut Bank to Browning for 4 months while I student taught. It's not perfect, but it's never let me down! Reason for selling is I will be moving down to Pocatello, ID and won't have the time to put the work into it it needs. Great little 4x4, I just can't justify trailering it down to Idaho with me.    It needs a few things to make it a truly comfortable reliable car though: -Driveline u-joints - Brakepads - Oil filter mount gasket - Rear main seal - Radiator flush and heater coil flush  Open to trades, and happy to answer questions.

The car has a very spacious truck area and the seats are very comfortable with plenty of room in the front and plenty of legroom in the rear.  I personally have just driven this car to Michigan over the holiday weekend as well as to Ohio to celebrate the end of 2019.  I had planned to use the car for work, however it is too nice to be dragging tools in and out of for work.  So I am going to a truck in place of this car.  The car had suffered some hail damage on the hood front deck and side last year. That hail damage has all been taken care of and the car is ready to go!

(231) 755-2116.Awards:  * 2015 KBB.com 10 Best Sedans Under $25,000Reviews:  * One of the more attractive interiors in the segment at an affordable price is tough to overlook. A refined 4-cylinder engine offers respectable fuel economy due in part to the new 9-speed automatic transmission. If it's power you seek, the Pentastar V6 serves up 295 horsepower. Source: KBB.com  * Strong V6 engine; composed ride and handling; high-quality interior materials; slick infotainment interface; available all-wheel drive. Source: Edmunds  * The advanced engineering of the redesigned 2015 Chrysler 200 results in highly efficient, refined performance. The exterior design blends coupe-like proportions with a tasteful fit and finish. A dynamic stance, wind-swept profile, finely sculpted curves and aggressive wheel-to-body proportions result in a sophisticated road presence. The 200 redefines the sedan interior. A traditional center console is replaced with one that is ergonomic and space efficient. It combines climate controls, the Electric Park Brake and connectivity functions with storage features. A connection to a USB or auxiliary media hub is located under the cup holder. Controls for the available dual-zone automatic temperature control are in short reach and easy to use. The 200 fuel economic ratings speak for themselves. The 2.4L Tigershark MultiAir II four-cylinder engine provides up to 36mpg HWY, while the available 3.6L Pentastar V6 engine delivers up to 31mpg HWY with 295hp. The Rotary E-shift features a wide gear ratio spread provides smooth, indecipherable transfer between gears at all speeds. Standard on all 200 models (except the LX) the Uconnect 5.0 System includes a high-resolution 5in touchscreen, one year of SiriusXM Radio, Integrated Voice Command, Bluetooth technology, a media hub with mobile device integration and more. To keep driving safe, 200 models include standard steel cage construction and eight airbags that help deliver excellent occupant protection in front, side and rear impacts. Advanced accident avoidance features include available Lane Departure Warning with Lane Keep Assist. Class-exclusive features include available Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop and Go functions, available Forward Collision Warning, and available Parallel Park Assist.

LT model loaded with power windows, power locks, dual power 6 way seats, cruise, keyless entry, leather, heated seats, steering wheel controls, BOSE audio, fog lights, push button 4x4, tow package, etc.  Zero mechanical issues whatsoever.  No leaks, squeaks, weird engine noises, nothing.  Runs, drives, steers, shifts, like a new one.  Does not pull one way or the other while driving down the highway at 70mph.  No check engine light or any other warning lights on in the dash.  4x4 works like it should both in 4high and 4low.  AC blows ice cold and heat works like it should.    Exterior is in excellent shape with no dents or dings.  No accidents, no paint work.  Paint shines like new.  No peeling, fading, or clear coat issues.  1 scratch on tailgate that I can send up close pictures to interested buyers.  Very few rock chips.  Super clean engine bay and undercarriage.  No rust.    Interior is in like new condition with no damage.  Leather is still in excellent shape with no rips or tears.  Carpet is clean and stain free.  No cracks or peeling on the dash.  Everything inside the truck works as it should.    Truck is all stock other than a spray in bed liner, 5th wheel rails, and a trailer brake controller.  Michelin Defender tires with around 3/4 tread.    Asking $18,500, clean and clear title in hand.  This is one of the cleanest 2003 3/4 ton trucks you will ever find.  Must see in person and drive to appreciate.  Very rare and hard to find being a 8.1, allison trans, and loaded out LT model.  This is a great option for someone that needs diesel pulling power, but is afraid of the expensive maintenance that comes along with owning a diesel.  This drive train is known for going 300k to half a million miles before needing a rebuild so this one is just now getting broke in.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

With its 2014 Silverado 1500, Chevrolet has staked its claim once again as king of the hill. The new Silverado boasts a refined level of comfort, sophistication, and brute force now found in trucks from Ford and Ram, specifically in the all-aluminum range of engines, where Chevy has laid claim to the most fuel-efficient V8 found in a full-size truck. In fact, at 23 mpg on the highway, the 5.3L unit provides a better return than the turbocharged V6 employed in the Ford F-150. Add in the fact that Chevy managed to make so many innovative changes while keeping the base price steady, and it's no surprise that the new Silverado is a hit. Strengths of this model include best fuel economy of any V8 pickup, Improved interior with added comfort and convenience, extensive features and options, and best-in-class tow ratings We want all trades!

A small plastic piece is missing from the front bumper.  We had dogs, woof.   RECENT REPAIRS (receipts avail): In 2017 we had Nate's Auto in Essex VT replace the engine with one with about 40,000 miles on it. We had them install a new clutch also. Those repairs were close to $7000  We also got four new Toyo summer tires this spring for $577.   Mike's Auto in Colchester VT replaced the sway bar links this fall for $200.  Shearer Volkswagon did all the TDI emissions recall work this fall. There is 100,000 mile warranty on that!!   OTHER INFO: There's 178,000 highway miles, on the body and it should go for another 100,000 now that it's got all new insides.     We bought it when it was a year old with 25,000 miles on it and have taken great care of it; Regular maintenance, oil changes, etc..  Touch screen stereo, heated front leather seats, tinted back seat and rear side windows, AC works great, cruise control, and power drivers seat.   2 keys, one valet key, floor mats, and manual included.   Comes with four studded Cooper Weathermaster on rims! (some of the studs popped out but there's plenty of tread for two more seasons) This car handles great in the snow!

Copy and Paste Direct Link to Our Website:  www.capmo.co/Mercedes4757 CALL or TEXT Capital Motor Company: (715) 800-8118.   We have for sale a beautiful, head turning low mileage Mercedes luxury roadster! This '94 Mercedes-Benz SL600 V-12 Grand Touring Roadster is stunning and a blast to drive. This car gets a ton of looks and compliments. The long hood with side fender vents and Chrome Wheels was the iconic look of success in the early 90âs and still gives this SL an incredible look today! As you can see from the photos this SL600 has been very well cared for. Having just 42,583 miles on it, the paint and body are exceptionally clean with very, very few imperfections and the interior is wonderful! If you like how it looks in the pictures you will love it when you come and drive it!Under the hood lies 12-Cylinders of German Engineered Precision and Power that propels this SL600 effortlessly around town and cruises along on the highway with 420 lb-ft of torque at your disposal, simply press the accelerator and the Mercedes thrusts you forward! It also features Adaptive Dampening Suspension which allows this grand touring Mercedes to handle crisply with minimal body roll without sacrificing a bit of your comfort! The suspension absorbs the bumps and cracks in the road and when you demand performance handling simply select the âSportâ mode and it will deliver firmer suspension with minimal body roll and better responsiveness! Because this SL600 is of the classic roadster design that means it has a Removable Hard Top and it also has a Power Convertible Soft Top that can be raised or lowered in about 30 seconds! While the hard-top offers all the benefits of a coupe with a quiet, refined ride, when it is removed you will love having the convenience of a power folding and raising soft top for those brief weather concerns or for added privacy in a crowded parking lot. The top functions fantastic and has been fully inspected for proper operation! As you might expect from a Mercedes, the seats are wonderfully comfortable with full power adjustments with memory function to save your perfect seat positions for the driver and passenger. They are also Heated Seats which is especially nice in a roadster! They heat up fast to not only make that cold morning drive to work or class much more enjoyable but they extend the âtop offâ driving season greatly by providing toasty warm seats! You really have to see and drive this SL600 to appreciate just how nice it is. You will have a hard time finding a cleaner, lower mileage Mercedes that needs absolutely nothing in terms of maintenance or repair! This SL has been fully inspected and is ready to be driven. We do TAKE TRADES and OFFER FINANCING as well. Please CALL or TEXT with any questions or your trade-in information: (715) 800-8118.

Bed Replaced (2)	Motor replaced approx. 5 years ago at 145K (3)	Backup Camera Installed (4)	Will need tires soon. Current BFG All-Terrain 315/70/17. (5)	Standard size is 285/70/17.

(15)	K&N Cold Air Intake installed but I have all the original parts if you want to change it back.  The Good: Itâs a Power Wagon. You get the 12K Warn Winch, 4.56 Gears with electronic lockers front and rear. Skid Plates, and forged wheels. It comes from the factory with a âSoftâ 1.5-inch suspension lift. It rides like a Â½ ton. Still a nice truck that has some good life left in it.  The Bad: Rust is starting to show. Rocker panels need to be replaced on drivers side. I am starting to work on that now but will discount if you buy the truck before I finish. Passenger side is starting to bubble up. Tailgate is getting rusty.  Bumpers need to be re-painted. They are 3/16 steel plate and are built to last. There is an engine light on. The code says it is exhaust sensors. It has a Magnaflow Dual Exhaust but that is probably getting old.  Some white paint and scratches on rear quarter where I slid up against a driveway light pole.  Engine Codes are as follows: The oxygen sensor that trouble code P0157 refers to, is located in the rear of the exhaust and behind the catalytic converter. Itâs main function is to regulate the amount of oxygen that comes from the catalytic converter. A lean mixture of oxygen and gas means that there is too much oxygen in the exhaust.  P0152 is the OBD-II generic code indicating that the O2 sensor for bank 2 sensor 1 fails to have a lower voltage output below 1.2 volts for more than 10 seconds indicating a lack of oxygen in the exhaust stream or a short to power in the sensor circuit. What causes the P0152 code? The engine control module (ECM) sees the voltage of the O2 sensor for bank 2 sensor 1 above 1.2 volts when the ECM has commanded the fuel to a targeted lean condition on that bank of the engine.  P0132 Meaning The front heated oxygen sensor (or O2 sensor 1) is placed into the exhaust manifold. It detects the amount of oxygen in the exhaust gas compared to the outside air. P0137 code definition. O2 Sensor Circuit Low Voltage (Bank 1, Sensor 2) What the P0137 code means. P0137 is the OBD-II generic code indicating the O2 sensor for bank 1 sensor 2 is failing to increase the voltage output above .21 volts indicating excessive oxygen in the exhaust.  Asking $6000. Not looking for trades. I have already replaced it with a new Ram 2500.",,me,43.64,-70.7298

Frequently Asked Questions  Q: My credits really bad, like really really bad, can I still buy a car? A: Yes! All we deal with is bad credit.  Q: Are you sure, I have multiple repos. A: Yes, we're sure!  Q: I have a new job, do I qualify? A: Yes, as long as you've got your first paystub you qualify!  Q:  What do I need to buy a car? A: Identification (ID card, license, out of state ID), Proof of income (paystub, SSI, bank statements, Paypal etc), Proof of residence (bill in your name, junk mail, anything going to the address you live at).  That's it!  Q:  Can I really get a car with $399 down? A: Yes, over 50% of our customers buy with that much down.  Q:  Ah ha! So sometimes you need more!? A: It's all based on budget, if you only qualify for a $250 payment but want a more expensive car, you may need some more down to qualify for it.  Q:  What kind of cars do you have? A: All kinds: Malibus, Impalas, Escalades, Altimas, Chargers, CRV's, Jaguars, Audi's, Hummers, Sentras, you name it!  We have over 100 cars, trucks, vans etc.  Go online and check us out at automartnv.com.   Q:  Some of the other places I've been to have garbage cars.. what do you have? A: We have normal cars- no salvage, title issues, or insane miles.   Q: What years are the cars you sell? A: We have a range of about 10 years, from around 2007 to 2017's!  Q: How do you guys get me approved when everyone else is turning me down? A: We have a unique relationship with private lending institutions that sell clumps of car loans to investors. This arrangement means they have much more leeway on who they loan to and the terms of those loans.  Q: What are your payments? A: The payments are from 15-20% of your income.

This model sets itself apart with extensive features and options, Improved interior with added comfort and convenience, best-in-class tow ratings, and best fuel economy of any V8 pickup This vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

MANUAL TRANSMISSION.  60,968 MILES  Volkswagen redesigned the Jetta for 2011, and when it was new, reviewers liked its spacious interior, saying that the Jetta has as much space as some 2011 midsize cars. Additionally, the Jettaâs trunk is one of the largest in the class. Inside, the cabin has a smooth, clean design, though test drivers disliked the 2011 Jettaâs hard, shiny plastics.  The 2011 Jetta comes with standard features that are typical of small cars, including air conditioning, cruise control, a four-speaker stereo and an auxiliary input jack. Look to higher trims for features like satellite radio, a USB port, Bluetooth and navigation.  Four engines are available in the 2011 Jetta. The S model has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder, while the SE and SEL trims get a more powerful 2.5-liter five-cylinder. The base model with a manual transmission has average fuel economy ratings, but higher trims get slightly fewer miles per gallon. The best performer in the lineup is the Jetta GLI, which has a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. The Jetta TDI offers the best fuel economy thanks to its 2.0-liter turbocharged diesel engine. Reviewers were mixed on the Jettaâs performance, though many were underwhelmed and felt other cars in the class were more fun to drive. The 2011 Jetta also performed very well in crash tests.  $1500 Down and a Job is All You Need YOUR JOB IS YOUR CREDIT!  BAD CREDIT OK - PAST REPO OK NO CREDIT? NO PROBLEM!

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

The staff at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South is committed to serving you, our friends and customers and we look forward to earning your business. For this reason, when dealing with Rick's Auto Marketing Center South you can be assured that your experience will be pressure free and that your satisfaction will be guaranteed.  Automotive Experience Richard Yow, of Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, opened his flagship dealership approximately 27 years ago in Carthage, North Carolina. Since this time, Richard has expanded his business nationwide by having a transparent business structure which has effectively built and continues to build customer loyalty. Proof of continued business excellence is evidenced by his flawless record with the Better Business Bureau, his reputation in the industry for ethical leadership and statewide recognition as a small business leader (as seen in North Carolina Small Business of the Year). Following present day operations at the North Carolina dealership, Richard vows to utilize the same practices and procedures at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South.  What Do We Sell? The automobiles being offered for sale at Rick's Auto Marketing Center South are prior corporate fleet lease automobiles and not prior rental or auction units.  How do You Benefit from Purchasing an Automobile from Rick's Auto Marketing Center South? As a consumer, you can be assured that the automobile you are purchasing has been mechanically maintained under a fleet service maintenance program since new. The maintenance program, which is similar to the preventative maintenance guidelines as suggested by the manufacturer, requires that all automobiles be timely inspected and undergo routine oil-changes and tune-ups. Furthermore, most of the off-lease automobiles offered for sale have only been assigned to and driven by one driver / owner before arriving on our lot.  What Sets Us Apart From the Others? From the moment you walk in the door, our friendly and relaxed staff will lead you through the buying process without the high pressure you find at other dealerships. At Rick's Auto Marketing Center South, we believe in clear no haggle pricing and aren't afraid to clearly list the purchase price on each automobile.  We are ready to serve you. Feel free to contact us with any comments or questions you may have.

I bought this car in Montana in 2016 when it had 60k miles. It was already a salvage vehicle - previous owner told me it hit a deer and they fixed it up. I wasn't planning on getting a new car for awhile because I love this one, but an opportunity presented itself and I couldn't pass it up. It's taken me on many road trips to and from Montana and Colorado and I've never had any issues with it.  Since I've had it, I've gotten oil changes every 3000-5000 miles, had rotors and brakes replaced last year. My mechanic told me it will need 2 new back tires pretty soon (quoted me $230 if that's helpful). Everything else is in good condition. There are a few light scratches on a back corner (see photo). This was my first car and I know it'll be a great car for someone else!  AC and heating work great Speakers are awesome Cruise control",,ca,34.2846,-119.22200000000001

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

High quality, fit and finish. Audi builds amazing cars fit for luxury and performance. This V8 S5 is a dream to drive! Just over 350 hp and plenty of torque. I bought the car in January but with the cost of our kids now going to private school I need to cut my loss and eliminate a car payment. I wash my car several time a week, you won't find a cleaner one then this. My family makes fun of me because I clean it too much. They also think Im crazy because I don't allow anyone to drink anything but water or eat in the car. Also, Im a non smoker. Everything works great and I have all the service records back to 30,000 miles because I know the previous owner. He told me the car was $65, 000 new! WOW what a deal this car is. Safety and security is yours with all-wheel drive! I have named her Rose but if you buy her you can name her anything you want lol. Go on Youtube and watch a few videos on the 2012 Audi S5 V8 and you will be very excited. The only things I would do to it would be replacing the front rubber bushings on the suspension with better ones and replace the oil pan seal. It doesn't leak oil on the drive way and you can't see any oil under the car unless you put it on a lift and remove the belly pan. But Im a bit OCD and like everything 100% dry under the motor. Just wanted to be all up front so there are no surprises since this is advertised way below book.",,sc,32.9756,-80.1831

Purchased 2014 in Berkeley Springs @ 178k miles. I put the truck on the rack-ZERO rust front to back. Installed new transmission (still have old one), did preventative engine rebuild including cam phasers in 2016. 4,000 miles since rebuild. Keithâs Truck Service installed plow in 2017 for $1,700. Plowed only a few driveways with it-works great. I thought Iâd keep the truck for 20 years, but my life has changed, which is why Iâm selling.  Forget the mileage, the improvements and wear item replacements set this vehicle up for long life and low maintenance. Wear items replaced: New tires, brakes, rotors, shocks/springs, exhaust including 2 of 3 catalytic converters, and battery. Some minors bumps and a minor rust spot around passenger rear fender. Inspected in the fall. Great value and able to be driven every day. Only needs a gas gauge sending unit but low fuel notice still  works.

The best-in-class power output is 295 horsepower and 262 lb-ft. of torque. Combined with a 9-speed automatic transmission and an AWD system, the Chrysler 200C has some respectable acceleration'',   Driving.ca online review (in 2014)  had this to say ''the new 200 C AWD is a very pleasant family sedan to drive, offering a nice blend of a comfortable ride and semi-athletic handling. Using the same AWD system as the Jeep Cherokee, the 200 C AWD is a front-driver the majority of the time, with its rear axle disconnected to save fuel. When the road does get slippery, the system can send 60% of the engines torque to the rear wheels. Driven with more gusto than the typical morning school run, the 200 C AWDs body control is kept well in-check.''' & ''For family sedan buyers looking for that rare combination of a V6 engine and traction at all four wheels, the 2015 Chrysler 200 C AWD is a compelling choice...''  THIS 200C HAS The SafeyTec Package  adaptive cruise control, brake assist, blind spot and rear cross-path detection, forward collision warning, lane departure warning, park assist, rain-sensing windshield wipers and SmartBeam headlamps, and many more convenience options.",,mn,46.7346,-92.1747

At The UN-Dealership we're all about helping customers save money on not only their vehicle purchase but also on any extended warranties or vehicle financing. Unlike the traditional franchise dealerships, we markup our vehicles roughly $800 to $1,000 each & try to sell as many vehicles as we can each month. Extended warranties & vehicle financing are HUGE profit centers for traditional franchise dealerships & often times add several thousand $$$$ dollars worth of extra negative equity to a customers loan. This doesn't even include all of the hassles, stresses, pressures, games, gimmicks, tricks, back & forth with the managers, spending your entire day at the dealership, or the many other unpleasantries that you most often have to endure when buying from a traditional franchise dealership. Skip the traditional dealership & visit The UN-Dealership instead! We GUARANTEE that our UN-Dealership car buying experience will change how you look at buying your next car, FOREVER! Our motto says it all: No Hassles, No Pressure, No Polyester Suits, & No Problems!  Auto Centrix is a Pet Friendly business.  Stop by today and let our resident mascot Sissy the Shih Tzu help you to find your next vehicle.  Shop with Sissy today!  A portion of sale proceeds from every vehicle that Auto Centrix sells is donated to local animal charities and other charitable organizations that help our local community.  Auto Centrix strongly believes in giving back to the very community that helps us to stay in business.        NEED HELP WITH FINANCING? No problem!  We work very closely with several different credit unions and other lenders, allowing us to offer financing options for customers of all credit types.   DO YOU HAVE NO CREDIT OR BAD CREDIT? - Don't worry!  Auto Centrix is able to help customers in this area also.  Pre-Qualification takes less then 5 minutes and can be done online before you even visit our indoor showroom.  Our unique customer approval process allows us to tell you exactly which of our vehicles you would qualify for based on the amount of your down payment & your monthly income.  We're all about giving our customers choices when it comes to their next vehicle.  Unlike the traditional dealerships, who will steer you towards a vehicle that better suits their needs and profits, instead of giving you the customer what you prefer or what's better suited for your overall needs.

We've lowered the price $700 for Christmas!  Head gasket job done.  Nice car both outside & in.  Perrin sway bars, ACR racing rims, Rally Armor mud flaps, Sentury Ultra High Performance 18"" tires, stiffer, lowered suspension, tinted windows, heated seats.  Boost gauge.  Tires have lots of life left with 9/32"" tread depth.  Imperfections seen in photos: driver's seat upholstery tear, rear passenger window tear in window tint. Temp gauge doesn't register.  Two options: (1) If you have a code reader, you can still get an accurate reading of engine temp.  (2) We'll give you another dashboard console which you could install and have Subaru program for the computer to recognize.  Regarding the essentials, an outside guy who knows WRX's came in and test drove this one.  He was VERY impressed and said he couldn't find a thing wrong with it.  Manual shift, lots of power with that turbo.  And of course it has Subaru's signature All-Wheel Drive transmission.  Make us an offer & find us at Strictly Subie, 303 E.

This car has been really good to me and is extremely fun to drive. It is unmolested with all the original parts. The only thing Iâve added is the R8 coils. This car is loaded with the top trim Autobahn package and has all the bells and whistles for that year. Tires recently replaced.  The only problem Iâve had with the car in the 40k miles Iâve put on it happened this past summer with the intake manifold. The intake manifold is a common part to fail on these years and usually costs $600 to replace/upgrade or you can do it yourself. It has not effected the drivability of the car. One other issue is the headliner is sagging in the backseat, probably due to me driving with the sunroof open all the time.  With all these things considered (mileage, age, condition, etc.), Iâve priced it at $7500. This car still has a lot of life in it and will make someone very happy.  Low ball offers will be ignored.
